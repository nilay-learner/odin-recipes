    <p>
      Kadhi Chawal is a popular and comforting Indian dish that combines a tangy yogurt-based curry, known as kadhi, with steamed rice (chawal). The kadhi is made by whisking yogurt with gram flour (besan) and spices, then simmering it until thickened and flavorful. It's often garnished with fresh coriander and served hot alongside fluffy rice. This dish is not only delicious but also nutritious, making it a staple in many Indian households. Perfect for a wholesome meal, Kadhi Chawal is loved for its unique blend of flavors and creamy texture.
